# Upgradeable







*An upgradeability mechanism designed for UUPS proxies. The functions included here can perform an upgrade of an {ERC1967Proxy}, when this contract is set as the implementation behind such a proxy. A security mechanism ensures that an upgrade does not turn off upgradeability accidentally, although this risk is reinstated if the upgrade retains upgradeability but removes the security mechanism, e.g. by replacing `UUPSUpgradeable` with a custom implementation of upgrades. The {_authorizeUpgrade} function must be overridden to include access restriction to the upgrade mechanism. _Available since v4.1._*

## Methods

### proxiableUUID

```solidity
function proxiableUUID() external view returns (bytes32)
```



*Implementation of the ERC1822 {proxiableUUID} function. This returns the storage slot used by the implementation. It is used to validate that the this implementation remains valid after an upgrade. IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bytes32 | undefined |

### upgradeTo

```solidity
function upgradeTo(address newImplementation) external nonpayable
```



*Upgrade the implementation of the proxy to `newImplementation`. Calls {_authorizeUpgrade}. Emits an {Upgraded} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newImplementation | address | undefined |

### upgradeToAndCall

```solidity
function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes data) external payable
```



*Upgrade the implementation of the proxy to `newImplementation`, and subsequently execute the function call encoded in `data`. Calls {_authorizeUpgrade}. Emits an {Upgraded} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newImplementation | address | undefined |
| data | bytes | undefined |



## Events
