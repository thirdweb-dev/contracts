# IDropClaimCondition





Thirdweb&#39;s &#39;Drop&#39; contracts are distribution mechanisms for tokens.  A contract admin (i.e. a holder of `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`) can set a series of claim conditions,  ordered by their respective `startTimestamp`. A claim condition defines criteria under which  accounts can mint tokens. Claim conditions can be overwritten or added to by the contract admin.  At any moment, there is only one active claim condition.
