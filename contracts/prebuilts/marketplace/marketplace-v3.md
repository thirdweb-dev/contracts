# Marketplace V3 design document.

This is a live document that explains what the [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) `Marketplace V3` smart contract is, how it works and can be used, and why it is written the way it is.

The document is written for technical and non-technical readers. To ask further questions about `Marketplace V3`, please join the [thirdweb discord](https://discord.gg/thirdweb) or create a [github issue](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/issues).

## Background

The [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) `Marketplace V3` is a marketplace where where people can sell NFTs ‚Äî [ERC 721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) or [ERC 1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) tokens ‚Äî at a fixed price ( what we'll refer to as a "Direct listing"), or auction them (what we'll refer to as an "Auction listing"). It also allows users to make "Offers" on unlisted NFTs.

`Marketplace V3` offers improvements over previous version in terms of design and features, which are discussed in this document. You can refer to previous (v2) `Marketplace` design document [here](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/prebuilts/marketplace-legacy/marketplace.md).

## Context behind this update

We have given `Marketplace` an update that was long overdue. The marketplace product is still made up of three core ways of exchanging NFTs for money:

1. Selling NFTs via a ‚Äòdirect listing‚Äô.
2. Auctioning off NFTs.
3. Making offers for NFTs not on sale at all, or at favorable prices.

The core improvement about the `Marketplace V3` smart contract is better developer experience of working with the contract.

Previous version had some limitations, arising due to (1) the smart contract size limit of `~24.576 kb` on Ethereum mainnet (and other thirdweb supported chains), and (2) the way the smart contract code is organized (single, large smart contract that inherits other contracts). The previous `Marketplace` smart contract has functions that have multiple jobs, behave in many different ways under different circumstances, and a lack of convenient view functions to read data easily.

Moreover, over time, we received feature requests for `Marketplace`, some of which have been incorporated in `Marketplace V3`, for e.g.:

- Ability to accept multiple currencies for direct listings
- Ability to explicitly cancel listings
- Explicit getter functions for fetching high level states e.g. ‚Äúhas an auction ended‚Äù, ‚Äúwho is the winning bidder‚Äù, etc.
- Simplify start time and expiration time for listings

For all these reasons and feature additions, the `Marketplace` contract is getting an update, and being rolled out as `Marketplace V3`. In this update:

- the contract has been broken down into independent extensions (later offered in ContractKit).
- the contract provides explicit functions for each important action (something that is missing from the contract, today).
- the contract provides convenient view functions for all relevant state of the contract, without expecting users to rely on events to read critical information.

Finally, to accomplish all these things without the constraint of the smart contract size limit, the `Marketplace V3` contract is written in the following new code pattern, which we call `Plugin Pattern`. It was influenced by [EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535). You can read more about Plugin Pattern [here](https://blog.thirdweb.com/).

## Extensions that make up `Marketplace V3`

The `Marketplace V3` smart contract is now written as the sum of three main extension smart contracts:

1. `DirectListings`: List NFTs for sale at a fixed price. Buy NFTs from listings.
2. `EnglishAuctions`: Put NFTs up for auction. Bid for NFTs up on auction. The highest bid within an auction‚Äôs duration wins.
3. `Offers`: Make offers of ERC20 or native token currency for NFTs. Accept a favorable offer if you own the NFTs wanted.

Each of these extension smart contracts is independent, and does not care about the state of the other extension contracts.

### What the Marketplace will look like to users

There are two groups of users ‚Äî (1) thirdweb's customers who'll set up the marketplace, and (2) the end users of thirdweb customers' marketplaces.

To thirdweb customers, the marketplace can be set up like any of the other thirdweb contract (e.g. 'NFT Collection') through the thirdweb dashboard, the thirdweb SDK, or by directly consuming the open sourced marketplace smart contract.

To the end users of thirdweb customers, the experience of using the marketplace will feel familiar to popular marketplace platforms like OpenSea, Zora, etc. The biggest difference in user experience will be that performing any action on the marketplace requires gas fees.

- Thirdweb's customers
  - Deploy the marketplace contract like any other thirdweb contract.
  - Can set a % 'platform fee'. This % is collected on every sale ‚Äî when a buyer buys tokens from a direct listing, and when a seller collects the highest bid on auction closing. This platform fee is distributed to the platform fee recipient (set by a contract admin).
  - Can list NFTs for sale at a fixed price.
  - Can edit an existing listing's parameters, e.g. the currency accepted. An auction's parameters cannot be edited once it has started.
  - Can make offers to NFTs listed/unlisted for a fixed price.
  - Can auction NFTs.
  - Can make bids to auctions.
  - Must pay gas fees to perform any actions, including the actions just listed.

### EIPs implemented / supported

To be able to escrow NFTs in the case of auctions, Marketplace implements the receiver interfaces for [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) and [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) tokens.

To enable meta-transactions (gasless), Marketplace implements [ERC2771](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771).

Marketplace also honors [ERC2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) for the distribution of royalties on direct and auction listings.

### Events emitted

All events emitted by the contract, as well as when they're emitted, can be found in the interface of the contract, [here](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/prebuilts/marketplace/IMarketplace.sol). In general, events are emitted whenever there is a state change in the contract.

### Currency transfers

The contract supports both ERC20 currencies and a chain's native token (e.g. ether for Ethereum mainnet). This means that any action that involves transferring currency (e.g. buying a token from a direct listing) can be performed with either an ERC20 token or the chain's native token.

üí° **Note**: The exception is offers ‚Äî these can only be made with ERC20 tokens, since Marketplace needs to transfer the offer amount from the buyer to the seller, in case the latter accepts the offer. This cannot be done with native tokens without escrowing the requisite amount of currency.

The contract wraps all native tokens deposited into it as the canonical ERC20 wrapped version of the native token (e.g. WETH for ether). The contract unwraps the wrapped native token when transferring native tokens to a given address.

If the contract fails to transfer out native tokens, it wraps them back to wrapped native tokens, and transfers the wrapped native tokens to the concerned address. The contract may fail to transfer out native tokens to an address, if the address represents a smart contract that cannot accept native tokens transferred to it directly.
